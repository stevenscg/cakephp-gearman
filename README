Gearman Client and Worker Shells for CakePHP 2.2.X

This is a very simple implementation of a Gearman (http://gearman.org)
client and worker as Shells in CakePHP.

It is intended to give you a working example and a starting
point for integrating Gearman into your CakePHP application.

Possible uses include:
* Geocoding addresses
* Remote API operations
* Photo manipulation

Installation
1) Unpack the project into your app directory.
2) Ensure that gearmand is installed (see http://gearman.org)
3) Ensure that the PHP wrapper is installed (see http://pecl.php.net/package/gearman)

Usage
1) Start gearmand (the examples assume 127.0.0.1).
2) Change to your CakePHP app directory.
3) In one terminal window, start the worker:
 Console/cake gearman_worker
4) In a different terminal window, execute the client:
 Console/cake gearman_client

After step 4, you should see something like this in your gearman_client terminal:
{"foo":"bar","now":1341884726,"response":"it worked"}

You can always see that your worker is running from the command line:
$> gearadmin --status

Synchronous vs Asynchronous
In the GearmanClientShell, there is a later section of code that you can use
to experiment with the asynchronous mode.  This is great for long-running tasks
or fire-and-forget applications.  It is a bit harder to work with, so I left the
synchronous example as the default.
